# Car_price_prediction
 Machine learning project using classic Regression method
* In order to seperate the dependenceis of this project its better to create a virtual environment --> python3 -m venv new_env
* Then in vs_code IDE (or any other ) we may install any dependencies in terminal after  the command (source new_env/bin/activate)

* 1_car_prediction is a jupyter noteBook in which there is lots of data visualization and codes which can be used to understand the raw data file. then there is a simple ML method for training a model to predict a price. and finally there is an example to test the model by user. great.
